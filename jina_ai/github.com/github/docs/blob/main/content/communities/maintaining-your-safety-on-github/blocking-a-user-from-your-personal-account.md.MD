Blocking a user from your personal account

 | 

You can block a user to deny them access to your activity and repositories, and to prevent them from sending you notifications.

About blocking users
--------------------

[](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/content/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-personal-account.md#about-blocking-users)

You can block a user in your account settings or from the user's profile. {% data variables.product.prodname\_dotcom %} will not notify the user when you block them. If you want to avoid contributing to the same project as someone you've blocked, you can choose to display a warning on any repositories with prior contributions from a blocked user. For more information, see "[Blocking a user in your account settings](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/content/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-personal-account.md#blocking-a-user-in-your-account-settings)." You may still see the activity of blocked users in shared spaces and blocked users can delete their existing content.

{% tip %}

**Tip:** If you're blocking a user because of a heated conversation, consider locking the conversation so only collaborators can comment. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/locking-conversations)."

{% endtip %}

When you block a user:

*   The user stops following you
*   The user stops watching and unpins your repositories
*   The user's stars and issue assignments are removed from your repositories
*   The user's votes on discussions or comments in your repositories are deleted
*   The user is removed as a collaborator on your repositories
*   The user's contributions to your repositories are no longer counted as contributions for them
*   Your contributions to the blocked user's repositories are no longer counted as contributions for you
*   You are removed as a collaborator on their repositories
*   Their sponsorship of you is canceled
*   Any pending repository or account successor invitations to or from the blocked user are canceled
*   The user is removed as a collaborator from all the projects and {% data variables.projects.projects\_v1\_boards %} owned by you
*   You are removed as a collaborator from all the projects and {% data variables.projects.projects\_v1\_boards %} owned by the user

After you've blocked a user, they cannot:

*   Send you any notifications, including by [@mentioning](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams) your username
*   Comment on or edit issues or pull requests that you've created
*   React to your comments on issues, pull requests, and commits
*   Follow you or see your content in their activity feed
*   Assign you to issues or pull requests
*   Invite you as a collaborator on their repositories
*   Invite you as a collaborator on a security advisory
*   Cross-reference your repositories in comments
*   Fork, watch, pin, or star your repositories
*   Sponsor you
*   Add you as a collaborator on their projects and {% data variables.projects.projects\_v1\_boards %}
*   Make changes to your public projects and {% data variables.projects.projects\_v1\_boards %}

In repositories you own, blocked users also cannot:

*   Open issues
*   Send, close, or merge pull requests
*   Comment on issues, pull requests, or commits
*   Add or edit wiki pages

Blocking a user in your account settings
----------------------------------------

[](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/content/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-personal-account.md#blocking-a-user-in-your-account-settings)

{% data reusables.user-settings.access\_settings %} {% data reusables.user-settings.blocked\_users %}

1.  Under "Block a user", type the username of the user you'd like to block, then click **Block user**.
2.  Optionally, to add a note to describe why a user was blocked, click **Add Note**. The note will only be visible to you.
3.  Optionally, you can display a warning when you visit a repository where a blocked user is a contributor. Under "Blocked users", select **Warn me when a blocked user is a prior contributor to a repository**.

Blocking a user from their profile page
---------------------------------------

[](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/content/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-personal-account.md#blocking-a-user-from-their-profile-page)

{% data reusables.profile.user\_profile\_page\_navigation %} {% data reusables.profile.user\_profile\_page\_block\_or\_report %}

1.  Optionally, add a note to describe why a user was blocked. The note will only be visible to you.
2.  Click **Block user**.
